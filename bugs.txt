doesn't work with lightweight components
need to adjust getComponentsOfAssemblyOptionalUpdateTree to just return paths; don't need all the modelDocs. 
* except for the check in and check out. Those need modeldocs. The other functions just use paths anyways. 

release all does not work with >3 parts. Fails for both tortoiseSVN and app. 
-> try making repo private?
