release all does not work with >3 parts. Fails for both tortoiseSVN and app. 
-> try making repo private?

Fix right click context menu to match svn language, eg. "Check In" -> "Commit" ; "Check Out" -> "Get Lock"

doesn't work with lightweight components
need to adjust getComponentsOfAssemblyOptionalUpdateTree to just return paths; don't need all the modelDocs. 
* except for the check in and check out. Those need modeldocs. The other functions just use paths anyways. 


Make buttons apply to currently selected component instead of top level assy

Correct in-context components to inherit parents. Bonus- Also allow right clicking on them for checkin/out as their parents.

ignore temporary "~" files
